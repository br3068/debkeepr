# debkeepr: Analysis of Non-Decimal Currencies

`debkeepr` integrates non-decimal currencies that use the tripartite system of pounds, shillings, and pence into the methodologies of Digital Humanities and the practices of reproducible research. The package makes it possible for historical non-decimal currencies to behave like decimalized numeric values, while also providing support for values with multiple units whose bases can differ. This is accomplished through the implementation of the `deb_lsd` and `deb_decimal` classes, which are based on the infrastructure provided by the [vctrs package](https://vctrs.r-lib.org/). `debkkeepr` simplifies the process of performing arithmetic calculations with non-decimal currencies — such as adding £3 13s. 4d. sterling to £8 15s. 9d. sterling — and also provides a basis for analyzing account books with thousands of transactions recorded in non-decimal currencies. The name of the `debkeepr` package derives from this latter capability of analyzing historical account books that use [double-entry bookkeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system).

## Installation
You can install `debkeepr` from GitHub with [remotes](https://remotes.r-lib.org):

```{r remotes, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jessesadler/debkeepr")
```

Please open an [issue](https://github.com/jessesadler/debkeepr/issues) if you have any questions, comments, or requests.

## Historical Background
The `debkeepr` package uses the nomenclature of [l, s, and d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%A3sd) to represent pounds, shillings, and pence units in non-decimal currencies. The abbreviations derive from the Latin terms [libra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_livre), [solidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidus_(coin)), and [denarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius). The libra was a Roman measurement of weight, while the solidus and denarius were both Roman coins. The denarius was a silver coin from the era of the Republic, in contrast to the golden solidus that was issued in the Late Empire. As the production of silver coins overtook that of gold by the 8th century, a solidus came to represent 12 silver denarii coins, and 240 denarii were — for a time — made from one libra or pound of silver. The custom of counting coins in dozens (solidi) and scores of dozens (librae) spread throughout the Carolingian Empire and became engrained in much of Europe. However, a variety of currencies or monies of account used [other bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-decimal_currency) for the solidus and denarius units. `debkeepr` provides a consistent manner for dealing with any set of bases within a tripartite system through the `bases` attribute of `deb_lsd` and `deb_decimal` vectors and the `unit` attribute of `deb_decimal` vectors.

Translations of libra, solidus, and denarius units:

- English: pounds, shillings, pence
- French: livres, sols or sous, deniers
- Italian: lire, soldi, denari
- Flemish: ponden, schellingen, groten
- Dutch: guilders, stuivers, penningen

## Usage
The `deb_lsd` and `deb_decimal` classes are implemented to deal with two interrelated problems inherent in historical currencies. Firstly, historical currencies consist of three separate non-decimal units: pounds, shillings, and pence. Secondly, the bases of the shillings and pence units differed by region, coinage, and era. The `deb_lsd` class maintains the tripartite structure of non-decimal currencies and provides a `bases` attribute to record the bases for the shillings and pence units. The print methods for both classes show the `bases` attribute, and `deb_decimal` vectors include the `unit`.

Note that all of the functions in `debkeepr` begin with the prefix `deb_`, which is short for double-entry bookkeeping.

```{r usage}
library(debkeepr)

# Create deb_lsd vectors with standard bases of 20s. 12d.
lsd1 <- deb_lsd(l = 3, s = 13, d = 4)
lsd2 <- deb_lsd(l = 8, s = 15, d = 9)

# Perform arithmetic
lsd1 + lsd2
lsd2 - lsd1
lsd2 * 2 - lsd1

# Combine multiple values together
c(lsd1, lsd2)
```

Both classes allow the user to define the solidus and denarius units of the values, enabling integration of currencies that do not use the standardized bases of 20 shillings to the pound and 12 pence to the shilling. An example of non-standard [money of account](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_account) is the Polish florin found in Dafforne's practice journal in which a florin consisted of 30 gros of 18 denars. All arithmetic calculations with `deb_lsd` vectors — `sum()`, `round()`, `+`, `-`, etc. — [normalize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic#Compound_unit_arithmetic) the values according to the chosen bases, making it much easier to do the compound unit arithmetic that non-decimal currencies make necessary.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/compound-arithmetic.png")
```

```{r bases}
# Create deb_lsd vector with standard bases of 20s. 12d.
(lsd3 <- deb_lsd(l = c(28, 32, 54, 18),
                 s = c(15, 8, 18, 12),
                 d = c(8, 11, 7, 9)))

# Same numerical values as Polish florins
(florins <- deb_lsd(l = c(28, 32, 54, 18),
                    s = c(15, 8, 18, 12),
                    d = c(8, 11, 7, 9),
                    bases = c(30, 18)))

# Different outcome with sum due to the bases
sum(lsd3)
sum(florins)

# Normalize a non-standard value to default bases
non_standard <- deb_lsd(132, 53, 35)
deb_normalize(non_standard)
```

The `deb_decimal` class represents non-decimal currencies in decimalized form. The class tracks the solidus and denarius bases and the unit represented by the decimalized values through the `bases` and `unit` attributes. When working with decimalized data is preferable, the `deb_decimal` class makes casting from and to `deb_lsd` possible without losing any metadata about the `bases` used, and therefore the actual value being represented.

```{r decimal}
# Create deb_decimal from numeric vector
(dec1 <- deb_decimal(c(5.525, 12.235, 8.45)))

# Same curreny values in solidus unit
(dec2 <- deb_decimal(c(110.5, 244.7, 169), unit = "s"))

# Equality between different units
dec1 == dec2

# Combining deb_lsd and deb_decimal gives a deb_lsd vector
c(dec1, lsd1, lsd2)

# Cast between deb_lsd and deb_decimal vectors
deb_as_lsd(dec1)
deb_as_decimal(lsd3)
deb_as_decimal(florins)

# Represented by solidus/shillings unit
deb_as_decimal(lsd3, unit = "s")

# Represented by denarius/pence unit
deb_as_decimal(lsd3, unit = "d")

# Either class can be cast to base numeric, which,
# of course, leads to the loss of all metadata
as.numeric(lsd3)
as.numeric(dec1)
```

## Differences between `deb_lsd` and `deb_decimal` vectors

See the [Getting Started with debkeepr vignette](https://jessesadler.github.io/debkeepr/articles/debkeepr.html) for an in depth discussion of the similarities and differences between the two classes.

- The `deb_lsd` class has the advantage of maintaining the structure and values used by non-decimal currencies, making it easier to identify and present such values.
- `deb_decimal` implements a wider array of mathematical functions and arithmetic operations than `deb_lsd`.
- Until [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) integrates record-style vectors based on the `vctrs` package more fully — which should happen with version 0.9.0 — `deb_lsd` vectors do not work with the `dplyr` functions `mutate()`, `summarise()`, and `arrange()`. However, the full complement of `dplyr` functions work with `deb_decimal` vectors.
- [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) does not know how to pick a scale for `deb_lsd` vectors. In contrast, `deb_decimal` vectors work properly with `ggplot2`, though explicitly identifying the scale as continuous — with `scale_y_continuous()` or `scale_x_continuous()` — is needed to avoid the appearance of a message.
- Casting methods between the two classes with `deb_as_lsd()` and `deb_as_decimal()` make it possible to move between the two classes without losing any data.
- `deb_lsd` and `deb_decimal` vectors cannot be combined in a single function if they have different `bases`. The only way to transform the bases of `deb_lsd` and `deb_decimal` vectors is explicitly with `deb_convert_bases()`.
