`debkeepr` integrates non-decimal currencies that use the tripartite system of pounds, shillings, and pence into the methodologies of Digital Humanities and the practices of reproducible research. The package makes it possible for historical non-decimal currencies to behave like decimalized numeric values through the implementation of the `deb_lsd` and `deb_decimal` vector classes or types. These types are based on the infrastructure provided by the [vctrs package](https://vctrs.r-lib.org/). `debkkeepr` simplifies the process of performing arithmetic calculations with non-decimal currencies — such as adding £3 13s. 4d. sterling to £8 15s. 9d. sterling — and also provides a basis for analyzing account books with thousands of transactions recorded in non-decimal currencies. The name of the `debkeepr` package derives from this latter capability of analyzing historical account books that often used [double-entry bookkeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system).

## Installation
You can install `debkeepr` from GitHub with [remotes](https://remotes.r-lib.org):

```{r remotes, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jessesadler/debkeepr")
```

Please open an [issue](https://github.com/jessesadler/debkeepr/issues) if you have any questions, comments, or requests.

## Historical Background
The `debkeepr` package uses the nomenclature of [l, s, and d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%A3sd) to represent pounds, shillings, and pence units in non-decimal currencies. The abbreviations derive from the Latin terms [libra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_livre), [solidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidus_(coin)), and [denarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius). The libra was a Roman measurement of weight, while the solidus and denarius were both Roman coins. The denarius was a silver coin from the era of the Republic, in contrast to the golden solidus that was issued in the Late Empire. As the production of silver coins overtook that of gold by the 8th century, a solidus came to represent 12 silver denarii coins, and 240 denarii were — for a time — made from one libra or pound of silver. The custom of counting coins in dozens (solidi) and scores of dozens (librae) spread throughout the Carolingian Empire and became engrained in much of Europe. However, a variety of currencies or monies of account used [other bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-decimal_currency) for the solidus and denarius units. `debkeepr` provides a consistent manner for dealing with any set of bases within a tripartite system through the `bases` attribute of `deb_lsd` and `deb_decimal` vectors and the `unit` attribute of `deb_decimal` vectors.

Translations of libra, solidus, and denarius units:

- English: pounds, shillings, pence
- French: livres, sols or sous, deniers
- Italian: lire, soldi, denari
- Flemish: ponden, schellingen, groten
- Dutch: guilders, stuivers, penningen

## Usage
The `deb_lsd` and `deb_decimal` types are implemented to deal with two interrelated problems inherent in historical currencies.

1. Historical currencies consist of three separate non-decimal **units**: pounds, shillings, and pence.
2. The **bases** of the shillings and pence units differed by region, coinage, and era.

The `deb_lsd` type maintains the tripartite structure of non-decimal currencies and provides a `bases` attribute to record the bases for the shillings and pence units. The `deb_decimal` type also contains a `bases` attribute, as well as a `unit` attribute to track which unit the decimalized value represents (pounds, shillings, or pence). The print methods for both types show the `bases` attribute, and `deb_decimal` vectors include the `unit`.

Let's see how this works in practice, beginning with `deb_lsd` vectors. Note that all of the functions in `debkeepr` begin with the prefix `deb_`, which is short for double-entry bookkeeping.

```{r usage}
library(debkeepr)

# Create deb_lsd vectors with standard bases of 20s. 12d.
lsd1 <- deb_lsd(l = 3, s = 13, d = 4)
lsd2 <- deb_lsd(l = 8, s = 15, d = 9)

# Combine multiple values together
c(lsd1, lsd2)
```

A primary reason for the creation of the `deb_lsd` type is to simplify arithmetic calculations with non-decimal currency. Doing calculations by hand requires the use of [compound unit arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic#Compound_unit_arithmetic) and normalization.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/compound-arithmetic.png")
```

All implemented arithmetic calculations with `deb_lsd` vectors — `sum()`, `round()`, `+`, `-`, etc. — automatically normalize the values according to the `bases` attribute. In addition, you can manually normalize non-standard values with `deb_normalize()`.

```{r arithmetic}
# Perform arithmetic
lsd1 + lsd2
lsd2 - lsd1
lsd2 * 2 - lsd1

# Normalize a non-standard value to default bases
deb_normalize(deb_lsd(132, 53, 35))
```

Both types allow the user to define the solidus and denarius units of values, enabling integration of currencies that do not use the standardized bases. For example, the Polish florin found in Dafforne's practice journal used the non-standard bases of 30 gros of 18 denars.

```{r bases, error = TRUE}
# Create deb_lsd vector with standard bases of 20s. 12d.
(lsd3 <- deb_lsd(l = c(28, 32, 54, 18),
                 s = c(15, 8, 18, 12),
                 d = c(8, 11, 7, 9)))

# Same numerical values as Polish florins
(florins <- deb_lsd(l = c(28, 32, 54, 18),
                    s = c(15, 8, 18, 12),
                    d = c(8, 11, 7, 9),
                    bases = c(30, 18)))

# Different outcome with sum due to the different bases
sum(lsd3)
sum(florins)

# Vectors with different bases cannot be combined since
# their relationship is unknown. Doing so results in an error.
sum(lsd3, florins)
```

In contrast to the tripartite structure of `deb_lsd` vectors, `deb_decimal` vectors represent non-decimal currencies in the more familiar decimal form. Internally, `deb_decimal` vectors are built on `double()` vectors. These decimalized vectors are linked to their non-decimal form through the `unit` and `bases` attributes.

```{r decimal}
# Create deb_decimal from numeric vector
(dec1 <- deb_decimal(c(5.525, 12.235, 8.45)))

# Same currency values in solidus unit
(dec2 <- deb_decimal(c(110.5, 244.7, 169), unit = "s"))

# Equality between different units
dec1 == dec2

# Equality between deb_lsd and deb_decimal vectors
# £5 10s. 6d. is equal to 1,326 pence
deb_lsd(5, 10, 6) == deb_decimal(1326, unit = "d")
```

When working with decimalized data is preferable, the `deb_decimal` type makes casting from and to `deb_lsd` possible without losing any metadata about the `bases` and therefore the actual value being represented. `deb_lsd` and `deb_decimal` vectors can also be combined with numeric vectors or cast from and to numeric vectors. `debkeepr` uses an internal [conversion hierarchy](https://vctrs.r-lib.org/articles/type-size.html) of `numeric()` -> `deb_decimal()` -> `deb_lsd()`.

```{r lsd-decimal}
# Combining deb_lsd and deb_decimal gives a deb_lsd vector
c(dec1, lsd1, lsd2)
c(dec1, lsd1, 8.25)

# Cast between deb_lsd and deb_decimal vectors
deb_as_lsd(dec1)
deb_as_decimal(lsd3)
deb_as_decimal(florins)

# Represented by solidus/shillings unit
deb_as_decimal(lsd3, unit = "s")

# Represented by denarius/pence unit
deb_as_decimal(lsd3, unit = "d")

# Either type can be cast to base numeric, which,
# of course, leads to the loss of all metadata
as.numeric(lsd3)
as.numeric(dec1)
```

## Comparing `deb_lsd` and `deb_decimal` vectors

See the [Getting Started with debkeepr vignette](https://jessesadler.github.io/debkeepr/articles/debkeepr.html) for an in depth discussion of the similarities and differences between the two types.

- The `deb_lsd` type has the advantage of maintaining the structure and values used by non-decimal currencies, making it easier to identify and present such values.
- `deb_decimal` implements a wider array of mathematical functions and arithmetic operations than `deb_lsd`.
- You can move between the two types without losing any data through `deb_as_lsd()` and `deb_as_decimal()` casting methods.
- Because `deb_lsd` and `deb_decimal` are based on the [vctrs](https://vctrs.r-lib.org/) package, both types act as expected in data frames or [tibbles](https://tibble.tidyverse.org) columns. From [dplyr 1.0.0](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/06/dplyr-1-0-0/) — which is the minimal version used by debkeepr — all dplyr functions work on both `debkeepr` types.
- [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) does not know how to pick a scale for `deb_lsd` vectors. In contrast, `deb_decimal` vectors work properly with `ggplot2`, though explicitly identifying the scale as continuous — with `scale_y_continuous()` or `scale_x_continuous()` — is needed to avoid the appearance of a message.
- `deb_lsd` and `deb_decimal` vectors cannot be combined in a single function if their `bases` differ. The only way to transform the bases of `deb_lsd` and `deb_decimal` vectors is explicitly with `deb_convert_bases()`. This prevents mistakenly combining two different currencies together without properly converting their values.
