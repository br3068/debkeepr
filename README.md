`debkeepr` provides an interface for working with non-decimal currencies
that use the tripartite system of pounds, shillings, and pence. The
package includes functions to apply arithmetic and financial operations
to single or multiple values and to analyze account books that use
either [single-entry
bookkeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-entry_bookkeeping_system)
or [double-entry
bookkeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system)
with the latter providing the name for `debkeepr`.

## Lifecycle

This branch of `debkeepr` has been retired in favor of a new API backed
by the [vctrs package](https://vctrs.r-lib.org/) that more fully
integrates non-decimal currencies into R. A fairly stable implementation
of the new API using the CRAN version of `vctrs` is on the [master
branch](https://github.com/jessesadler/debkeepr). Current development to
keep up with the changes to `vctrs` is on the [vctrs
branch](https://github.com/jessesadler/debkeepr/tree/vctrs).

Note that this retired branch currently has more capabilities than the
new API, particularly in working with non-decimal currencies in data
frames. The new API has to wait for `vctrs` to be better integrated into
the `tibble` and `dplyr` packages. These capabilities will be added to
the new API as soon as possible.

## Installation

You can install `debkeepr` from GitHub with
[remotes](https://remotes.r-lib.org):

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jessesadler/debkeepr", ref = "list-class")
```

## lsd Class

The pounds, shillings, and pence monetary system complicates even
relatively simple arithmetic manipulations, as each unit has to be
[normalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic#Compound_unit_arithmetic)
or converted to the correct base. To unite pounds, shillings, and pence
units into a single value and associate the shillings and pence units
with non-decimal bases `debkeepr` implements a special class of R
object. The **lsd** class consists of a list of one or more numeric
vectors of length 3 and a `bases` attribute attached to the list.
`debkeepr` provides functions to manipulate objects that can be coerced
to class `lsd`, `lsd` objects on their own, or `lsd` list columns in a
data frame.

## Historical Background

The `debkeepr` package uses the nomenclature of [l, s, and
d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%A3sd) to represent pounds,
shillings, and pence units. The abbreviations derive from the Latin
terms [libra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_livre),
[solidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidus_\(coin\)), and
[denarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius). The libra was a
Roman measurement of weight, while the solidus and denarius were both
Roman coins. The denarius was a silver coin from the era of the
Republic, in contrast to the golden solidus that was issued in the Late
Empire. As the production of silver coins overtook that of gold by the
8th century, a solidus came to represent 12 silver denarii coins, and
240 denarii were — for a time — made from one libra or pound of silver.
The custom of counting coins in dozens (solidi) and scores of dozens
(librae) spread throughout the Carolingian Empire and became engrained
in much of Europe. However, a variety of [other
bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-decimal_currency) for the
solidi and denarii units were in use in different regions and at
different times. `debkeepr` provides a consistent manner for dealing
with any set of bases within a tripartite system through the `bases`
attribute of an `lsd` object.

    modern double-entry bookkeeping.

## Overview

  - All of the functions in `debkeepr` begin with the prefix `deb_`,
    which is short for double-entry bookkeeping.
  - The nomenclature used throughout the package follows the [original
    Latin terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%A3sd) in using l, s,
    and d to represent librae, solidi, and denarii respectively and to
    refer to such values as lsd values. These terms were translated into
    the various European languages.
      - English: pounds, shillings, pence
      - French: livres, sols or sous, deniers
      - Italian: lire, soldi, denari
      - Dutch: ponden, schellingen, groten or penningen
  - The functions are designed to be used in three types of contexts:
    1.  Manipulation of single or multiple lsd values represented as an
        object of class `lsd` or an object that can be coerced to class
        `lsd`: a numeric vector of length 3 or a list of such vectors.
    2.  A data frame with one or more list column of class `lsd`.
    3.  A data frame that mimics the structure of an account book and
        can be thought of as a transactions data frame. In addition to
        an `lsd` list column that denotes the value of each transaction,
        a transactions data frame contains variables recording the
        [credit and debit
        account](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debits_and_credits) for
        each transaction.
  - Data
      - `debkeepr` contains two data sets from the example journal and
        ledger in the third edition of Richard Dafforne’s *Merchant’s
        Mirrour* from 1660. Dafforne’s text taught the practices of
        double-entry bookkeeping and provided a full set of account
        books to be used for educational purposes.
      - `dafforne_transactions` is a transactions data frame with 177
        transactions.
      - `dafforne_accounts` possesses information about the 46 accounts
        in the journal and ledger.

## Examples

At the heart of `debkeepr` is the need to normalize pounds, shillings,
and pence values to specified non-decimal unit bases in the process or
making various calculations. Even in the simplest case of addition,
`debkeepr` makes the process easier and less error prone. A historian
working with economic data will often come across sets of monetary
values that need to be added together. `debkeepr` provides multiple
means to accomplish this frequent task.

  - Add the separate units by hand and then normalize.
  - Do the addition with `debkeepr` by supplying numeric vectors of
    length three.
  - Create an object of class `lsd` and proceed with the addition.

For example, adding together a set of values by hand might result in the
non-standard form of £131 62s. 41d. in a currency with the standard
bases of 20 shillings per £1 and 12 pence per shilling.

``` r
library(debkeepr)

# Normalize £131 62s. 41d.
deb_normalize(c(131, 67, 42), bases = c(20, 12))
#>       l  s d
#> [1] 134 10 6

# Addition of values with debkeepr
deb_sum(c(15, 9, 11),
        c(32, 17, 8),
        c(18, 8, 9),
        c(54, 15, 4),
        c(12, 18, 10))
#>       l  s d
#> [1] 134 10 6

# Create lsd object from list of vectors, then do addition
lsd_values <- deb_as_lsd(list(c(15, 9, 11),
                              c(32, 17, 8),
                              c(18, 8, 9),
                              c(54, 15, 4),
                              c(12, 18, 10)),
                         bases = c(20, 12))
deb_sum(lsd_values)
#>       l  s d
#> [1] 134 10 6
```

Objects of class `lsd` can also be used within data frames as a list
column. The values can be manipulated through `debkeepr` functions in
concert with `dplyr::mutate()`. The [tibble
package](https://tibble.tidyverse.org) provides native support for list
columns, enabling an `lsd` object to be linked to attribute data such as
the person, object, or date associated with the monetary values. Here, a
tibble is created with an `lsd` list column and a column listing three
people — a, b, and c — who could be said to have purchased goods. It is
then possible to manipulate the values, showing, in this example,
interest over a two year period at 8% and the new value due.

``` r
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)

# Create a tibble with an lsd list column
(lsd_tbl <- tibble(person = c("a", "c", "b", "c", "b"),
                   lsd = lsd_values))
#> # A tibble: 5 x 2
#>   person lsd       
#>   <chr>  <lsd>     
#> 1 a      15, 9, 11 
#> 2 c      32, 17, 8 
#> 3 b      18, 8, 9  
#> 4 c      54, 15, 4 
#> 5 b      12, 18, 10

# Interest of 8% over a two year period
lsd_tbl %>% 
  mutate(interest = deb_interest(lsd = lsd,
                                 interest = 0.08,
                                 duration = 2,
                                 with_principal = FALSE),
         due = deb_add(lsd1 = lsd,
                       lsd2 = interest))
#> # A tibble: 5 x 4
#>   person lsd        interest          due               
#>   <chr>  <lsd>      <lsd>             <lsd>             
#> 1 a      15, 9, 11  2.00, 9.00, 7.04  17.00, 19.00, 6.04
#> 2 c      32, 17, 8  5.00, 5.00, 2.72  38.00, 2.00, 10.72
#> 3 b      18, 8, 9   2, 19, 0          21, 7, 9          
#> 4 c      54, 15, 4  8.00, 15.00, 3.04 63.00, 10.00, 7.04
#> 5 b      12, 18, 10 2.00, 1.00, 4.96  15.00, 0.00, 2.96
```

Once created `lsd` objects maintain the `bases` attribute provided to
them. However, it is often necessary to convert between currencies with
different bases for the shillings and pence units. This is possible with
the `deb_convert_bases()` function. For example, taking the monetary
values in `lsd_tbl` as representing pounds Flemish, we can find the
equivalent guilders if the sales occurred in Holland. Guilders were of
20 stuivers but a stuiver was equal to 16 penningen. In addition,
guilders were tied to the pound Flemish at the rate of 6 guilder to £1
Flemish.

``` r
# Convert from Flemish pounds to guilders
lsd_tbl %>% 
  mutate(guilders = deb_convert_bases(lsd = lsd,
                                      bases2 = c(20, 16),
                                      ratio = 6))
#> # A tibble: 5 x 3
#>   person lsd        guilders  
#>   <chr>  <lsd>      <lsd>     
#> 1 a      15, 9, 11  92, 19, 8 
#> 2 c      32, 17, 8  197, 6, 0 
#> 3 b      18, 8, 9   110, 12, 8
#> 4 c      54, 15, 4  328, 12, 0
#> 5 b      12, 18, 10 77, 13, 0
```

A common action for such a collection of values would be to add together
the purchases by the “person” column. This can be done in the normal
[tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org) manner, but with a special
`summarise()` function for an `lsd` list column, `deb_summarise()`.

``` r
# Sum of purchases by person
lsd_tbl %>% 
  group_by(person) %>% 
  deb_summarise(lsd)
#> # A tibble: 3 x 2
#>   person lsd      
#>   <chr>  <lsd>    
#> 1 a      15, 9, 11
#> 2 b      31, 7, 7 
#> 3 c      87, 13, 0
```

An issue with the implementation of a list column to hold monetary
values is that such a column cannot be plotted. Because of this and
other issues inherent in list columns, `debkeepr` has robust support for
[decimalization](https://jessesadler.github.io/debkeepr/reference/index.html#section-decimalization).
There are functions to decimalize pounds, shillings, and pence values to
any of the three units and to go in the opposite direction from any
decimalized unit to lsd values. For plotting purposes the most useful
workflow is to go from pounds, shillings, and pence to decimalized
pounds.

``` r
# Create decimalized pounds variable
lsd_tbl %>% 
  mutate(pounds = deb_lsd_l(lsd = lsd))
#> # A tibble: 5 x 3
#>   person lsd        pounds
#>   <chr>  <lsd>       <dbl>
#> 1 a      15, 9, 11    15.5
#> 2 c      32, 17, 8    32.9
#> 3 b      18, 8, 9     18.4
#> 4 c      54, 15, 4    54.8
#> 5 b      12, 18, 10   12.9

# Use decimalized pounds variable to plot value owed by each person

lsd_tbl %>% 
  mutate(pounds = deb_lsd_l(lsd = lsd)) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = person, y = pounds), stat = "identity") + 
  theme_light()
