\title{Convert between different bases for shillings and pence units}
\usage{
deb_convert_bases(lsd, bases1 = NULL, bases2, ratio = 1, round = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{bases1}{Numeric vector of length 2 used to specify the bases for the
shillings or s and pence or d values of \code{lsd}. If \code{lsd} is of class lsd,
the bases attribute will be used in the place of this argument.}

\item{bases2}{Numeric vector of length 2 used to specify the bases for
the shillings or s and pence or d values to which \code{lsd} will be converted.}

\item{ratio}{The ratio between the two currencies that possess different
bases. This is the value by which \code{lsd} is multiplied. Numeric vector of
length 1 with the default of \code{1}.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class lsd with a bases attribute conforming
to \code{bases2}.
}
\description{
Convert between pounds, shillings, and pence currencies that use different
bases for the shillings and pence units.
}
\details{
\code{deb_convert_bases()} is similar to \code{\link[=deb_exchange]{deb_exchange()}}, but the latter performs
exchange on currencies that share the same shillings and pence bases.

\code{deb_convert_bases()} is the only way to change the bases attribute of an
lsd object.
