\title{Exchange between pounds, shillings and pence currencies}
\usage{
deb_exchange(lsd, shillings_rate, bases = c(20, 12), round = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{shillings_rate}{The exchange rate. This follows the common practice
of calculating the exchange rate between different currencies in terms
of shillings. Thus, in terms of a given number over the base of shillings
provided in the \code{bases} argument. A numeric vector of length 1.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class lsd with a bases attribute.
}
\description{
Exchange between pounds, shillings, and pence currencies that share the
same bases for shillings and pence given an exchange rate calculated on
the basis of shillings.
}
\details{
\code{deb_exchange()} is a wrapper around \code{\link[=deb_multiply]{deb_multiply()}}. It uses shillings
as the basis for the conversion between the currencies. If the conversion
between currencies is presented in pounds or pence, it may be easier to
use \code{\link[=deb_multiply]{deb_multiply()}}. If the bases for the shillings and pence units differ
between the two currencies use \code{\link[=deb_convert_bases]{deb_convert_bases()}}.
}
\examples{
# Exchange at the rate of 31 shillings
deb_exchange(lsd = c(850, 16, 10), shillings_rate = 31)

# Exchange between currencies that use the same alternative bases
deb_exchange(lsd = c(850, 16, 10),
             shillings_rate = 31,
             bases = c(20, 16))

# Exchange for an object of class lsd will use the bases attribute
lsd <- deb_as_lsd(lsd = c(850, 16, 10), bases = c(20, 16))
deb_exchange(lsd = lsd, shillings_rate = 31)

# If the exchange rate is in shillings and pence, you can either
# decimalize the shillings or add the pence and divide by 12 in
# the shillings_rate argument. If the decimalized shillings has
# a repeating decimal, the latter approach is preferable.

# Exchange at the rate of 31 shillings 4 pence
deb_exchange(lsd = c(850, 16, 10), shillings_rate = 31.33333)
deb_exchange(lsd = c(850, 16, 10), shillings_rate = 31 + 4/12)

# Exchange of a list of lsd values at a single rate
lsd_list <- list(c(40, 5, 9), c(29, 7, 1), c(35, 6, 5))
deb_exchange(lsd = lsd_list, shillings_rate = 31)

# Or an lsd object with alternative bases
lsd_list2 <- deb_as_lsd(lsd = lsd_list, bases = c(20, 16))
deb_exchange(lsd = lsd_list2, shillings_rate = 31)
