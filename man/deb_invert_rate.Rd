\title{Calculate the inverse of an exchange rate}
\usage{
deb_invert_rate(exchange_rate, output = c("shillings", "pence",
  "pounds"), bases = c(20, 12), round = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{exchange_rate}{An lsd value. An object of class lsd or an object that
can be coerced to class lsd: a numeric vector of length 3 or a list of
such vectors. The values do not need to be normalized.}

\item{output}{Choice of either \code{"shillings"}, \code{"pence"}, or \code{"pounds"} for
the format in which the exchange rate will be returned. \code{"shillings"},
the default, returns the exchange rate in terms of shillings and pence.
\code{"pence"} returns the exchange rate in terms of pence. \code{"pounds"} returns
the exchange rate in terms of pounds, shillings, and pence.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class lsd with a bases attribute. The format
of the returned value is determined by the \code{output} argument, either
pounds, shillings, and pence; shillings and pence; or just pence.
}
\description{
Given an exchange rate between two lsd currencies, calculate the inverse
rate, or the rate in the opposite direction.
}
\examples{
# Find the inverse exchange rate of 33s. 4d.
# Flemish pounds per pound sterling
deb_invert_rate(exchange_rate = c(0, 33, 4))

# Inverse of an exchange rate of Â£2 13s. 4d. in pence
deb_invert_rate(exchange_rate = c(2, 13, 4),
                output = "pence")

# Inverse of an exchange rate with alternative bases
deb_invert_rate(exchange_rate = c(0, 33, 4), bases = c(20, 16))

# Inverse rate of an object of class lsd will use the bases attribute
lsd <- deb_as_lsd(lsd = c(0, 33, 4), bases = c(20, 16))
deb_invert_rate(exchange_rate = lsd)

# Find the inverse of multiple exchange rates
rates <- list(c(0, 33, 4), c(0, 31, 0), c(0, 30, 0))
deb_invert_rate(exchange_rate = rates)
