\title{A class for pounds, shillings and pence values}
\usage{
deb_lsd(l, s, d, bases = c(20, 12))

\method{format}{deb_lsd}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{l}{Numeric vector representing the pounds unit.}

\item{s}{Numeric vector representing the shillings unit.}

\item{d}{Numeric vector representing the pence unit.}

\item{bases}{Numeric vector of length 2 used to specify the bases for the
shillings or s and pence or d units. Default is \code{c(20, 12)}, which
conforms to the most widely used system of 1 pound = 20 shillings and
1 shilling = 12 pence.}

\item{x}{An object.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed on to further methods.}

\item{lsd}{Numeric vector of length 3 or list of numeric vectors of length
3. The first position of the vector represents the pounds value or l. The
second position represents the shillings value or s. And the third
position represents the pence value or d.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class lsd with a bases attribute.
}
\description{
Pounds, shillings, and pence values are stored as a list of numeric vectors
of length 3 that possesses a bases attribute to record the non-decimal bases
for the shillings and pence units of the values. The first position of each
vector represents the pounds value or l. The second position represents the
shillings value or s. And the third position represents the pence value or
d. The bases attribute is stored as a numeric vector of length 2 with the
first value recording the shillings base and the second value the base of
the pence units. lsd objects can be used as list columns in a data frame.
}
\details{
The lsd class and the \code{debkeepr} package use the nomenclature of
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/£sd}{l, s, and d} to represent pounds,
shillings, and pence units. The abbreviations derive from the Latin terms
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_livre}{libra},
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidus_(coin)}{solidus}, and
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius}{denarius}. In the 8th century a
solidus came to represent 12 denarii coins, and 240 denarii were made from
one libra or pound of silver. The custom of counting coins in dozens
(solidi) and scores of dozens (librae) spread throughout the Carolingian
Empire and became engrained in much of Europe. However,
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-decimal_currency}{other bases} for the
solidus and denarius units were also in use. The \code{bases} attribute makes
it possible to specify alternative bases for the solidus and denarius units.

\examples{
## Create lsd objects from separate l, s, and d vectors ##

# lsd object for £10 6s. 8d.
deb_lsd(l = 10, s = 6, d = 8, bases = c(20, 12))

# lsd object for the Dutch system of guilders, stuivers, and penningen
deb_lsd(l = 10, s = 6, d = 8, bases = c(20, 16))

# lsd object from vectors of length > 1: all must be the same length
deb_lsd(l = c(10, 8, 5),
        s = c(6, 13, 8),
        d = c(8, 4, 10),
        bases = c(20, 12))
